\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I am a persevering person with great interest in learning. I am the first graduate of my family and my parents' two families, and the first scientist in my community. That is why I have always been interested in sharing my knowledge and learning anything that makes me curious. My grandfather was a garbage collector, and he always gave me the books he found, especially the science ones, he called me a mad scientist. Because of this, I love physics and grew up wanting to be a scientist. My desires were reinforced thanks to my professors, who shared their knowledge with me. At the beginning of my PhD project I had to deal with many problems with the experimental system, this taught me the value of teamwork, discipline, and the effort that research deserves. In addition, I decided to link it with another of my interests, programming, and everything related to the open-source world. I consider computational physics to be one of the most powerful tools in experimental physics, the knowledge obtained by the laboratory and the models developed by the theory are the seed to understand physics.

\lettersection{Why QNS?}
I was following the research developed at QNS and attracts me your interest of quantum research. Furthermore, I consider that can you give me knowledge, tools, friends, and colleagues with whom to develope new and innovation quantum nanoscience tools and knowledge. 
Nowadays, at the finishes of my PhD I'm very interested to research quantum and topological behavior in nanostructures, the results of my PhD work they have taken me to focussed to understand spin behavior. 
The cultural relation is another important aspect that I considered to choice QNS, unfortunately I had several cases of racism along of my academical formation and this  caused disappointment to fulfill my dreams.  The physics doesn't consider gender, skin color or preferences, their research is free and must be shared.
